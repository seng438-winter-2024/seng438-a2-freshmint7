# 1 Introduction

We will begin by examining the methods to be tested. We will then review the JavaDoc index.html file to read up on the documentation and understand how the methods are expected to work. After examination, we will choose the methods we believe are most well-suited to showcase our knowledge of testing methods. With our methods chosen, we plan to examine each one in more depth, coming up with equivalence classes and potential boundary tests.

# 2 Detailed description of unit test strategy

Returns the lower bound for the range.
Range - getLowerBound():
Input Domain:
lower - any double <= upper bound within allowable values.

Equivalence Classes:  
Valid lower bound:
Lower bound is a valid value within a reasonable range (e.g., within the limits of double precision).
Lower bound is at the minimum allowable value:
Lower bound is the smallest valid double value.
Lower bound is just above the minimum allowable value:
Lower bound is a value just above the smallest valid double value.

Lower bound is at the maximum allowable value:
Lower bound is the largest valid double value.

^^^This cannot be tested since the lower bound must be less than the upper bound but the upper bound cannot be larger than the maximum allowed value.^^^

Lower bound is just below the maximum allowable value:
Lower bound is a value just below the largest valid double value.
Invalid lower bound:
Lower bound is NaN (Not a Number).

# 3 Test cases developed

Equivalence Class Partitioning:
We identified different equivalence classes for each method based on the expected behaviour and the range of valid input values.
Each equivalence class represented a distinct category of input values that should produce similar behaviour from the method under test.

Boundary Value Analysis:
We selected test cases at the boundaries of the equivalence classes to ensure thorough testing of edge cases.
Boundary values often represent points where the behaviour of the method may change, making them critical for detecting potential issues.

Test Case Design:
We designed test cases to cover both normal and boundary conditions for each method.
Test cases were named descriptively to indicate the scenario being tested and the method under test.

Benefits of Using Mocking:
Isolation:
Mocking allows us to isolate the unit under test from its dependencies, enabling focused testing on specific components.
Control:
With mocking, we can control the behaviour of dependencies to simulate different scenarios and edge cases.
Efficiency:
Mocking reduces the need for extensive setup and teardown procedures, making tests more efficient to write and execute.

Drawbacks of Using Mocking:
Complexity: 
Mocking frameworks can introduce complexity, especially for inexperienced developers, leading to difficult-to-understand tests.
Maintenance Overhead: 
Mocks need to be kept up-to-date with changes in the system under test, which can introduce maintenance overhead.
Risk of Over-Mocking: 
Over-reliance on mocking may lead to tests that are tightly coupled to implementation details, making them brittle and prone to breakage with refactoring.

# 4 How the team work/effort was divided and managed

We organized our workload by assigning responsibilities between the Range and DataUtilities classes. Each team member took ownership of writing test cases and defining equivalence classes for either two or three methods within their assigned class. We collaborated, offering support to group members facing challenges and providing assistance when needed. Additionally, we engaged in peer reviews, thoroughly examining each other's test cases and offering constructive feedback to ensure the quality and effectiveness of our testing efforts.


# 5 Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

One challenge we collectively faced was getting used to the Eclipse IDE as we had mostly used VScode before. After reviewing lab instructions and through the process of completing the lab itself, we were able to better understand the integration of JUnit in the Eclipse IDE. 


# 6 Comments/feedback on the lab itself

As previously stated, our group was much more familiar with VScode and it is our preferred IDE and we have used it for JUnit testing before. Consequently, we would have much preferred the use of VSCode for this lab as we feel it is a more modern IDE and functions identically to Eclipse in terms of testing.
